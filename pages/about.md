# About

Launched in 2020 as a community for analyst, bloggers, and real estate enthusiasts, this site is a library of thought on different aspects on life, analytics and real estate.
If you love analytical thinking, sharing knowledge, and real estate, youâ€™ll feel right at home here. With more than 1.5 years in the field of data analytics and a life long passion for real estate investing,
this post shares the insights I have derived from these components with you all. You love travelling? Well I have got some pointers on that too. The site was inspired by fellow Medium bloggers who share very thoughtful and inspiring ideologies for the benefit of the rest. I welcome you all, to this space of blog...!!!
